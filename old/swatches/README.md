# Swatches

This simple Sketch 3 plugin will generate a palette of color swatches for you. All you need to do is enter in the appropriate hexadecimal values.

When you hit "OK" it will generate a 130x130 pixel rectangle filled with the hex color, a color label for you to change, and both hexadecimal and RGB values along the bottom. Pretty simple. Handy for styleguides!
