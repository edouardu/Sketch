## Known Issues / What's Next
1. Send to Slackbot is not working as of Nov 21, 2014. Waiting for the Slack team to fix an API issue for this to get resolved.
2. Options for sending directly to a user is on it's way.
3. I'm looking into what else can be shared besides just artboards. If you have any suggestions, open an issue!
