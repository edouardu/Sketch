Plugins for Bohemian Coding Sketch

## Duplicate to All Artboards

This plugin takes the selected layers and makes a copy for each artboard in the page, scaling them in the process:

The selected layers have to be inside an artboard.

## Golden Ratio

Make a bigger or smaller copy of the selection using the golden ratio. Here's an example of using it to recreate the iCloud icon (I know it's not correct, it's just a quick example):

## Installation

2. Copy the contents of the ZIP to the Plugins Folder (You can get access to that folder by opening the Plugins menu, choosing `Custom Script...` and then clicking in the gear icon and choosing `Open Plugins Folder`). You don't need to copy the `images` folder, the `README.md` nor the `LICENSE` files.
